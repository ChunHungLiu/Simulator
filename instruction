sudo python run_simulator.py --definition 1-core/baseline --configurations lru/1m --folder /home/abhishek/Cache-sim/Simulator/results --workload-file 1-core/mytest


When I use 1-core/2l/baseline instead of 1-core/baseline, I get errors like component file not found, which is due to type not 
found, which is due to improper stringstream input from Definition/COnfiguration file



Instructions before running

Make approrpiate path changes in the following files 
1. run_simulator.py
2. MemoryComponent.h (COMPONENTS_FOLDER)
3. Put the traces as <workloadname>.gz in the traces folder
OR Copy the traces from abhowmic@vseshadr.ece.cmu.edu:../../scratch/vseshadr/traces into a local traces folder




To try out first experiment,  
1. Changed llc-pref to llc-dbi in Definitions/1-core/baseline
2. No change in configs
3. Added a file llc-dbi/lru/1m in Components folder
4. Added line : dbi-size 128 in Components/llc-dbi/lru
