When run using DBI , the sim ipc increase by 9% as compared to using llc-pref. 
Variation in sim ipc between two runs of llc-pref is 0. There is no difference in either the sim ipc or the sim log.

With llc-pref, there are prefetch counters and a miss-0 counter (?)

When cleaning operation for the DBI is added to the CmpLLCDBI, 
then the sim ipc and simlog are same with and without dbi






We should compare against baselie LLC, that is, use a definition file which has component baseline-llc and not llc-pref
One such definition is
